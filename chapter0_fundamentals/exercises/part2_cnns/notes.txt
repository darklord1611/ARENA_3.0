# Parameter Initialization
- uniform Kaiming initialization -> calculated based solely on the size of current layer
- Xavier initialization -> calculated based on previous and next size + current size of the layer
- both aims to keep the variance of activations calculated by those initialized weights constant or within range of each other -> avoid extreme gradient updates


- logits are translation invariant aka adding constant doesn't change the probabilities after going through softmax
